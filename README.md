However, former President Donald Trump has authored several books, including "The Art of the Deal," which was published in 1987 and details his business strategies and experiences. He has also written other books such as "Trump: The Art of the Comeback," "Trump: Surviving at the Top," "Trump: The Way to the Top," "Trump: Think Like a Billionaire," and "Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again." These books primarily focus on his business career, his political views, and his experiences in the public eye.

However, it's important to note that new books are continually being published, and it's possible that a trilogy of books about Donald Trump or his presidency may have been released since then.
